Cassandra Crossno – The Grief Empire's Digital Thunderdome

HOW TO USE (because even rebels need directions sometimes):

1. Grab all these files and dump them in a folder.
2. Put your images in an `images/` folder (see index.html for what’s needed, or just change the links).
3. Put your fonts in `fonts/` (see fonts/README.txt for font details and font-face hooks).
4. If you want to ZIP it up, select all these files, right-click, and “Compress” or “Send to ZIP”—whatever your OS calls it.
5. Upload it, share it, or just stare at it and feel powerful.

Want more pages? Just ask for them:  
“Bring me about.html!”  
“Give me shop, you magnificent bastard!”  
You get the idea.

If you break something, blame the internet. Or your ex.
