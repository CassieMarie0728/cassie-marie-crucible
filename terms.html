        <strong>Terms of Service:</strong>
        Welcome to my digital brawl. If you use this website, you agree not to be a jerk, not to steal my stuff, and not to sue me because you didn’t like what you read. If you act like an ass, you’ll be banned from the Crucible. I don’t guarantee anything, except that you’ll get the unfiltered truth. If you don’t like it, the exit’s that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Content Ownership:</strong>
        Everything here is mine unless otherwise noted. Don’t copy, paste, or republish without written permission, or you’ll get a cease & desist with extra sarcasm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Liability:</strong>
        If you take my advice and end up crying in your car, that’s on you. If you break the site, your computer, or your spirit, also on you. Don’t blame me for your existential crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Updates:</strong>
        I can change these terms whenever I want, usually after someone does something stupid.
