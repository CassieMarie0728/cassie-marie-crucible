        Some days, surviving means not going to jail. Today was one of those days.
        I survived the parade of “You’re so strong” and “Everything happens for a reason” by clenching my fists and gritting my teeth so hard I nearly cracked a molar.

        Here’s the thing: not killing anyone isn’t exactly an Olympic event, but in the world of grief, it damn well should be. If you’re reading this, you probably know the feeling—when the next person to drop a platitude is going to get a faceful of rage and maybe a coffee mug to the head.

        Bottom line: If you got through today without committing a felony, you’re making progress. Celebrate the wins, even if they look like a slightly smaller disaster.
